You are free to contribute however mind these things:
1. Do not submit pull requests that could break the bot.
2. Do not submit pull requests that add malicious code.
3. Do not submit pull requests that change the bot's behavior in a way that is not intended.
4. Don't submit massive pull requests with a bunch of different changes in them, each category should be a different PR.
5. Be mind of others, don't submit something only because you want it. The chances of me approving user specific changes are very low unless its actually useful.

Note: There is 0 guarentee your PR will be accepted, if you are not sure you can join the discord and confirm with me there before going forward with your PR.
