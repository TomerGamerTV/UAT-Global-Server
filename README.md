Hello bray I'll be detaching this fork for now since im 99% sure ur not coming back

# ⚠️🚨 !!ATTENTION!! 🚨⚠️  
### THE [ORIGINAL CREATOR](https://github.com/BrayAlter/UAT-Global-Server) IS MISSING IN ACTION 

unfortunately I too will no longer have time to work on this so hopefully he returns soon

⏰ On **September 30th 2025 onwards** I will no longer have time to work on this.  
I will do what I can to iron out everything before then.  
But when a new scenario shows up (Make a new track, grand live ect ect), I need **YOUR** help to make a **fork** to deal with that.  

I will be relying on you guys to automate the future senarios. 🙏

If not I guess ill be stuck playing URA lmao

> ***This project is for educational purpose only, [use it at your own risk](https://umamusume.com/news/100029/)***


## 📄 **License & Credits**

This project is a **Global Server adaptation** of the original China Server version by [@shiokaze](https://github.com/shiokaze/UmamusumeAutoTrainer).

### **Original Project**
- **Original Author**: [@shiokaze](https://github.com/shiokaze/UmamusumeAutoTrainer)
- **Original Repository**: [UmamusumeAutoTrainer](https://github.com/shiokaze/UmamusumeAutoTrainer) (China Server)

-This is now a detatced fork of [UmamusumeAutoTrainer](https://github.com/BrayAlter/UAT-Global-Server)

## 🚀 **Features**

### **Core Automation**
- ✅ **Automatic Training**: Complete training scenarios for ALL Uma Musume  
  - This includes the handling of:  
    - **Custom races** 
    - **Skill acquisition**
    - **Claw machine**
    - **Running styles** 
    - **Alarm clock usage** 
    - **Building fiendship early, focus on rainbows later** 
    - **Optimal event choices (Knows when to build friendship/recover energy and mood)** 
    - **Skipping bad turns with wit training**


- ✅ **Completely hands off**: Recover tp, Starting runs, finding the right guest card
  - Everything is automated you can just afk for **DAYS** until legacy umas are full
  - Handles everything from disconnections to the game crashing. The show will go on as long as there isn't a new update.
  - Supports background play via emulators.


- ✅ **Saving of presets**: Save training parameters for easy access in future runs 

## 🚨 **Safety**
- Question: Is this safe?
- Answer: Safer than the steam release (All of your processes are transparent lmao), I have done what I can to humanize the inputs. **BUT** if they decide to put in the effort they **WILL** find you. It is near impossible to simulate perfect human behavior with code so use at your own risk. I take no responsibility.  **HIDING BEHIND A EMULATOR DOES NOT MAKE YOU UNDETECTABLE**

running this 24/7 looks sus as hell so I would suggest turning it off for a few hours every day. 
(im just gonna risk it and run it 24/7 ill let you guys know if i get banned)

### **Race Selection Interface**

### **Skill Selection Interface**

## ⚠️ **Important Notes**

### **Game Settings**
1. **Graphics**: Must be set to "Standard", not "Basic"
2. **Training Setup**: **Manually select** Uma Musume, Legacy, and Support Cards in-game before starting
3. **Support Cards**: Avoid friend cards (no specific outing strategy)

### **Website Settings RECOMMENDED**
- **Attribute Setting**: Set desired target attributes in the UI. If unsure, do a manual run first and copy the resulting attributes into the UAT interface.
- **Race Selection**: Configure your race schedule to avoid failing fan-count goals. Use the Smart Character Filter; it preserves selections when changing characters and can keep only compatible races.
- **Skill Optimization**: Configure desired skills. Priority `0` means the bot will purchase those skills first.
- **Manual Skill Purchase**: Enable to select end-of-career skills manually while keeping auto-learning during training.

## 🔧 **Troubleshooting**

### **Common Issues**

#### **Fan Goals Fail**
- **Failed to the next goal races because lack of Fans**: Configure the race selection first in the UAT website to avoid lack of Fans

#### **ADB Device Detection**
- **No devices found**: Ensure emulator is running and ADB is enabled and open the umamusume app
- **ADB server issues**: The app automatically restarts ADB server if needed
- **Device not detected**: Check emulator's ADB settings

#### **PowerShell Script Issues**
- **Script crashes**: Open console first to see error messages
- **Execution policy**: Reference: [PowerShell Execution Policy](https://www.jianshu.com/p/4eaad2163567)

#### **Connection Problems**
- **ADB connection fails**: Close accelerators, kill adb.exe, restart emulator
- **Recognition errors**: Manual operation to next turn, reset task in WebUI

#### **Web Interface Issues**
- **Module loading fails**: Ensure proper file permissions and paths
